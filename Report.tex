\chapter{Introduction}
"Paila Technology", first of its kind in Nepali market, is a robotics and AI startup established on December 12, 2016 by Bijay Raut along with five other engineering graduates from IOE, Pulchowk Campus. The company started with a core team of seven members and the team has grown ever since. The company aims to produce world class robotics and industrial automation products that are suitable for businesses.
The company started with Automatic Dhara, automation for homes and have now transitioned into robotics by presenting their flagship project Pari, a robot for Nepal SBI Digital InTouch branch at Durbar Marg. Pari is a product that created a new market segment of robotics in Nepali market.

Paila is an entrepreneurial venture started with the prime motive to meet the demands of the market by developing a viable business model around some innovative products, services processes and platforms integrated with Artificial Intelligence and Robotics. The business model was a huge success in context of Nepal and the customerbase of the company is on rise. In a short span of time, the company has delivered products and services to some of the biggest names in the country including SBI Nepal Limited, nLocate, Gyani Traders and more to count.

\section{Vision}
The primary vision of "Paaila" can be considered as production of human friendly robots and to aid in the technological development of the country by embracing AI in different fields. It wants to aid other companies in integrating AI in their products as well to make AI and robotics available to everyone.

\section{Objectives}
The major objectives set by the company are:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Be the best workplace for robotics and AI
  \item Be the best option for businesses seeking robotics Services
  \item Help Nepali companies integrate AI into their products and services.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Variable Frequency Drive}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Introduction \\
    A Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) is a type of motor controller that drives an electric motor by varying the frequency and voltage supplied to the electric motor. Other names for a VFD are variable speed drive, adjustable speed drive, adjustable frequency drive, AC drive, and inverter. As the application's motor speed requirement change, the VFD can simply turn up or down the motor speed to meet the speed requirement.

  \item Working\\
    The first stage of a Variable Frequency AC Drive, or VFD, is the Converter. The converter is a comprised of six diodes, which are similar to check values used in plumbing systems. They allow current to flow in only one direction; the direction shown by the arrow in the diode symbol. For example, whenever A-phase voltage (voltage is similar to pressure in plumbing systems) is more positive than B or C phase voltages, then that diode will open and allow current to flow. When B-phase becomes more positive than A-phase, then the B-phase diode will open and the A-phase diode will close. The same is true for the 3 diodes on the negative side of the bus. Thus, we get six current "pulses" as each diode opens and closes. This is called a "six-pulse VFD", which is the standard configuration for current Variable Frequency Drives.

    \begin{center}

        \captionof{figure}{Converter in a VFD}
    \end{center}

    If the drive is operating on a 480V power system, then the 480V rating is "rms" or root-mean-squared. The peaks on a 480V system are 679V. The VFD dc bus has a dc voltage along with an AC ripple. The voltage runs between approximately 580V and 680V.

    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics{vfd2}
        \captionof{figure}{Converter with DC Bus in a VFD}
    \end{center}

    A capcitor is added to get rid of the AC ripple on the DC bus. A  capacitor operates in a similar fashion to a reservoir or accumulator in a plumbing system. This capacitor absorbs the ac ripple and delivers a smooth dc voltage. The AC ripple on the DC bus is typically less than 3 Volts. Thus, the voltage on the DC bus becomes "approximately" 650VDC. The actual voltage will depend on the voltage level of the AC line feeding the drive, the level of voltage unbalance on the power system, the motor load, the impedance of the power system, and any reactors or harmonic filters on the drive. \\

    The diode bridge converter that converts AC-to-DC, is sometimes just referred to as a converter. The converter that converts the dc back to ac is also a converter, but to distinguish it from the diode converter, it is usually referred to as an "inverter". It is common in the industry to refer to any DC-to-AC converter as an inverter.

    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics{vfd3}
        \captionof{figure}{Converter, DC Bus, and inverter in a VFD}
    \end{center}

    When one of the top switches in the inverter is closed, that phase of the motor is connected to the positive dc bus and the voltage on that phase becomes positive. When one of the bottom switches in the converter is closed, that phase is connected to the negative dc bus and becomes negative. Thus, any phase on the motor can be made positive or negative at will and can thus generate any frequency. Also, any phase can be made positive, negative, or zero.

    \begin{center}
      \includegraphics{vfd4}
      \captionof{figure}{Output response of a VFD}
    \end{center}

    The output from the VFD is of "rectangular" wave form. VFD's do not produce a sinusoidal output. This rectangular waveform would not be a good choice for a general purpose distribution system, but is perfectly adequate for a motor.

  \item Benefits
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Electric motor systems are responsible for more than 65\% of the power consumption in industry. Optimizing motor control systems using VFDs can reduce energy consumption and energy costs.
      \item Using VFDs, equipments can be operated at optimimum and efficient speeds, thereby extending the equipment life and reducing maintenance costs.
